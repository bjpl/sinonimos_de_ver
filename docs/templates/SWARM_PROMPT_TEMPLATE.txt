You are orchestrating a Claude Flow Swarm using Claude Code's Task tool for agent execution.

🎯 OBJECTIVE: For each term marked 'Literary' (context: "literario") in [PROJECT_NAME], elegantly integrate a brief but multi-part narrative experience that appropriately and authentically integrates the synonym.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project: [sinonimos_de_hablar / sinonimos_de_caminar / etc.]
- Verb theme: [speech / movement / etc.]
- Literary terms: [List terms from grep command]
- Target: [N] narratives

🐝 SWARM CONFIGURATION:
- Strategy: auto
- Mode: centralized
- Max Agents: 4
- Parallel Execution: MANDATORY

📋 EXECUTE ALL IN ONE MESSAGE:

Task("Literary Researcher", "
Analyze data/synonyms.json and identify all terms with context='literario'.

For each literary term, document:
1. Verb and its precise meaning
2. Current examples and how they're used
3. Cultural notes and regional usage
4. Narrative potential - what kind of story would authentically showcase this verb?
5. Thematic opportunities specific to [PROJECT THEME]

Store findings in structured format at: docs/research/literary_synonyms_analysis.json

Use coordination hooks:
- BEFORE: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description 'Analyze literary terms'
- DURING: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --memory-key 'swarm/researcher/analysis'
- AFTER: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task
", "researcher")

Task("Narrative Writer", "
Create elegant multi-part narrative experiences for each literary synonym term.

LITERARY TERMS: [List from analysis phase]

REQUIREMENTS per narrative:
1. Authentically demonstrates the verb in context
2. Has 3 connected narrative moments (not isolated sentences)
3. Matches Latin American Spanish literary style
4. Each part: 60-90 words
5. Progressive structure (setup → development → reflection)
6. Showcases nuanced meaning that distinguishes from basic verb
7. Culturally appropriate settings and characters
8. Includes literary note explaining the demonstration

FORMAT for each:
{
  'verb': 'VERB',
  'narrativeExperience': {
    'title': 'Evocative Title',
    'parts': [
      'Part 1: Scene establishment',
      'Part 2: Nuanced usage development',
      'Part 3: Meta-reflection on meaning'
    ],
    'literaryNote': 'How this narrative demonstrates the verb uniquely'
  }
}

Save to: docs/literary_narratives.json

Use hooks for coordination throughout work.
", "coder")

Task("Quality Reviewer", "
Review narrative experiences for literary quality and authentic integration.

REVIEW CRITERIA (score each 1-10):
1. Literary sophistication - Elegant prose worthy of Latin American literary tradition
2. Authentic integration - Verb usage feels natural, not forced
3. Cultural appropriateness - Fits regional context and literary norms
4. Semantic precision - Captures nuanced meaning vs. simple alternatives
5. Multi-part coherence - Parts connect and build progressively
6. Overall impact - Would this enhance learning?

For each narrative provide:
- Quality score (1-10)
- Specific strengths (2-3 points)
- Suggested improvements (if score <9)
- Cultural/linguistic accuracy check
- Final recommendation (approve/revise)

TARGET: 8.5+/10 average across all narratives

Wait for coder to complete, then review docs/literary_narratives.json

Save review to: docs/narrative_quality_review.md
", "reviewer")

Task("System Architect", "
Design integration architecture for narrative experiences.

REFERENCE: Study sinonimos_de_ver implementation at:
- docs/narrative_integration_design.md (architecture reference)
- components/NarrativeViewer.js (component pattern)
- services/narrativeProgress.js (progress tracking pattern)

DESIGN DELIVERABLES:
1. Updated JSON schema with narrativeExperience field
2. Component architecture (NarrativeViewer design)
3. UI/UX flow (how users access narratives)
4. Progress tracking strategy (LocalStorage schema)
5. Integration approach (story buttons, openNarrative function)
6. Deployment strategy
7. Performance targets

Create: docs/narrative_integration_design.md

Use ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format for key decisions.

CUSTOMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with actual project name
2. Replace [N] with actual number of literary terms
3. List literary terms from grep results
4. Adjust narrative themes to match verb type (speech, movement, etc.)
5. Update file paths if project structure differs

REMEMBER: Launch ALL agents in ONE message for parallel execution!
