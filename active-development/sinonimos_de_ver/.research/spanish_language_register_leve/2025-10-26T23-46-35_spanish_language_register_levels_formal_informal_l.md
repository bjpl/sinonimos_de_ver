**Query:** Spanish language register levels formal informal literary colloquial verbs of perception Mexico Colombia Argentina Chile
**Date:** 2025-10-26T23:46:35.262Z

## Answer

Spanish has a rich system of **register levels**—formal, informal, literary, and colloquial—that vary by context and region, including in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. These registers affect vocabulary, grammar, and especially the use of **verbs of perception** and address forms, with notable regional differences[1][5][8].

### **1. Register Levels in Spanish**

Spanish registers are typically divided into three main categories, though some sources further subdivide them:

| Register Level      | Description                                                                                   | Example Contexts                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Colloquial/Informal (R1)** | Very informal, casual, familiar, often grammatically relaxed or elliptical.                | Friends, family, casual messages  |
| **Standard/Polite (R2)**     | Neutral, polite, educated, grammatically standard.                                      | School, work, public interactions |
| **Formal/Literary (R3)**     | Highly formal, literary, official, meticulous, often used in academic or ceremonial speech.| Academic writing, ceremonies      |

- **Colloquial**: Frequent use of slang, contractions, and region-specific expressions.
- **Formal**: Use of full verb forms, careful grammar, and sometimes archaic or literary vocabulary.
- **Literary**: Elevated style, rare words, complex syntax, and rhetorical devices[1][5][8].

---

### **2. Regional Variation: Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile**

#### **Forms of Address and Verb Conjugation**
- **Mexico & Colombia**: Predominantly use **tú** (informal) and **usted** (formal). In Colombia, **usted** is sometimes used even in informal contexts, especially in certain regions[2][5][8].
- **Argentina & Chile**: Use **vos** (voseo) as the informal singular, with unique verb forms (e.g., *vos pensás* instead of *tú piensas*). In Chile, voseo is common in speech but less so in writing, and *tú* is also used, especially in formal or semi-formal contexts[2][5][8][10].

#### **Colloquial and Literary Usage**
- **Argentina**: Accepts constructions like *adelante mío* (in front of me), which are colloquial and considered standard locally but rejected in Mexico and Colombia, where *delante de mí* is preferred[1][8].
- **Chile**: Known for rapid speech, heavy use of slang, and unique colloquial expressions, making Chilean Spanish particularly challenging for learners[5][10].
- **Mexico & Colombia**: Regarded as having "clear" and "neutral" Spanish, but each region has its own slang and informal expressions[5].

---

### **3. Verbs of Perception and Register**

**Verbs of perception** (e.g., *ver*—to see, *oír*—to hear, *sentir*—to feel) can shift in formality depending on register:

- **Colloquial**: May use simplified or regularized forms, especially among children or in rural speech (e.g., *oyo* instead of *oigo* for "I hear")[1].
- **Standard/Formal**: Use correct, prescriptive forms (*oigo*, *veo*, *siento*).
- **Literary**: May employ metaphorical or archaic uses, or complex syntactic structures (e.g., *Es una maravilla ver cómo el feto...*—"It is a marvel to see how the fetus...")[5].

---

### **4. Register Markers in Grammar and Vocabulary**

- **Pronouns**: Choice of *tú*, *vos*, or *usted* signals register and varies by country[2][8][10].
- **Verb Forms**: Voseo in Argentina/Chile uses distinct conjugations (e.g., *vos ves*, *vos sentís*), while Mexico/Colombia use *tú ves*, *tú sientes*[10].
- **Lexicon**: Words like *chamaca* (Mexico), *chica* (Spain), *muchacha* (Colombia), and *piba* (Argentina) all mean "girl" but reflect regional and sometimes register differences[8].
- **Set Phrases**: Literary or formal registers use connectors and vocabulary rarely found in everyday speech (e.g., *por mor de*, *de suerte que*, *vilipendiar*, *motu proprio*)[5].

---

### **5. Perception and Social Factors**

- **Perception of Colloquiality**: Native speakers are sensitive to subtle register shifts, while L2 learners may struggle to perceive or produce appropriate register[9].
- **Social Factors**: Age, status, intimacy, and context all influence register choice. For example, a young person may use *vos* with friends in Argentina but *usted* with elders in Colombia[1][5][8].

---

### **6. Summary Table: Register and Regional Variation**

| Country     | Informal Pronoun | Formal Pronoun | Colloquial Features         | Literary/Formal Features           |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Mexico      | tú               | usted         | Clear, region-specific slang| Standard grammar, formal *usted*   |
| Colombia    | tú/usted         | usted         | Clear, some regional slang  | Frequent formal *usted*            |
| Argentina   | vos              | usted         | Voseo, unique colloquialisms| Literary voseo accepted            |
| Chile       | tú/vos           | usted         | Rapid, slang-heavy, voseo   | Literary forms less common in speech|

---

### **Key Points**

- **Register** in Spanish is a spectrum from colloquial to literary, shaped by context and region[1][5][8].
- **Mexico and Colombia**: Use *tú*/*usted* distinction; clear, standard forms are common.
- **Argentina and Chile**: Use *vos* (voseo) in informal speech, with unique verb forms; colloquial expressions may be standard locally but not elsewhere.
- **Verbs of perception** and other grammar points shift in formality and may be regularized in colloquial speech, especially among children or in rural areas[1].
- **Literary and formal registers** use more complex syntax, rare vocabulary, and are often reserved for academic, ceremonial, or written contexts[5][8].

These distinctions are essential for effective communication and cultural competence in Spanish across different countries and contexts.

Pedro A most dominant factor in the use of language and, in the case of the present book, of grammar, is register, or variety or level of language determined by the communicative situation in which the speaker or writer fi nds him/herself. In other words, the level of language we resort to depends, to a very large extent, on whether we are speaking with friends, which would attract a colloquial style or writing a letter or delivering a lecture involving a standard style or even a very formal register entailing an elevated type of expression. The levels of language may differ from informal to formal, and are deter- mined by four factors: sex, age, status and intimacy. All these factors affect, in varying degrees, the way we use language in areas of both vocabulary and grammar. Of course,... the present work is concerned exclusively with grammar, the use of which will be pre- sented in the context of register, when suitable and necessary. Register assignations as treated in this book will appear as either R1, R2 or R3. These subsections may be summa- rized in the following manner: extreme informality extreme formality R1 R2 R3 very informal, casual, colloquial, familiar, elliptical, grammatically unsound, repetitive, pleonastic standard, polite, educated, grammatically sound formal, literary, offi cial, language of scholars and purists, meticulously correct, reluctant to admit new grammatical structures www.cambridge.org © in this web service Cambridge University Press Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-42961-0 - A Reference Grammar of Spanish R.

It must be stressed that these subdivisions are the result of an artifi cial division, and that the reality behind them consists of subtle, imperceptible shifts, not rigidly defi ned cat- egories. We have confi ned these register divisions to three, as being more practicable to handle, although one could argue the case for more. Looking towards the future, it is possible that some of what are deemed incorrect usages contained in R1 will become socially acceptable language. An excellent illustration of this point is the previous reluctance of British English to admit different to or different than, American importations but now gaining credibility. Similarly, the former resistance of Iberian Spanish to the spelling México as it appears in the country of that name, as opposed to Méjico, has now faded. In point of fact, México now appears quite regularly in Spain. It is manifestly obvious that the fact that the Spanish language is spoken over vast... territories will inevitably entail grammatical diversity and even uncertainty, in the light of which what is acceptable in one Spanish- speaking country is unacceptable in another. One does, of course, need to examine what is meant by “correctness.” There are two senses in which a language is “correct.” The fi rst relates to a foreigner’s manipulation of the language. If what is said is unacceptable to a native speaker or writer in any register, then it is “incorrect.” The second is connected to a native speaker’s attitude to her/his own language, and this is a more complex matter. In the popular and educated mind, there exists a close association between “correct” and the standard language: features of local varieties and registers which differ from “standard” usage are deemed “incorrect,” even though they are used by native speakers. The Real Academia Española (RAE) was... once recognized as the guardian of the “correctness” of Spanish, but this is no longer the case (see note 2 in the introduction, p. xvii). There are as many academias as there are Spanish- speaking countries, and they all enjoy linguistic parity, and the judgment of correctness has in many cases become arbitrary. An Argentinian would fi nd the juxtaposi- tion of adverb and possessive pronoun adelante mío (in front of me), cerca tuyo (near you) perfectly admissible and would therefore classify them as R2, but these expressions would be considered strange by a Colombian, a Mexican or a speaker from the Iberian Peninsula, who doubtless would reject them. Of course, everyone would agree on the acceptabil- ity of delante de mí, considering it as R2. Yet how many Spanish- speakers of standard Spanish would admit delante mío as R2? Probably none. It would fall into the category... of R1. Finally, the formal ante mí would correspond to an R3 category. Yet all these four expressions have validity in their own way, according to circumstances, locality, region or country. To note how these register categories vary, there follows a small compendium of examples illustrating how register is marked in the treatment of Spanish grammar in the present book. The categories R1 and R2 are mainly used here by way of illustration. It should be borne in mind that these are only rough indications, and that such divisions do not necessarily apply to all Spanish- speaking countries.

In Spanish America (A, C and M, for instance, and all well attested), as well as in Spain, children, particularly young ones, and some adults, will readily say andé and andó instead of the standard anduve and anduvo (See Seco, Diccionario de dudas on andar), with repercussions for the imperfect subjunctive: andara, andaras, etc.... Preterits are in fact especially subject to regularization. Thus, chil- dren will say cabí (= cupe, from caber), conducí (= conduje, from conducir), podí (= pude, from poder), poní (= puse, from poner), satisfací (= satisfi ce, from satisfacer), traí (= traje, from traer) and vení (= vine, from venir). Needless to add, verbal regularization with children has its equivalent in English with, for example, she felled down, he caughted the ball. The present tenses of the following verbs are prone to confusion: caber: “cabo” instead of the standard quepo – No quepo aquí. (There’s no room for me here.) oír: “oyo” instead of the standard oigo – No te oigo. poner: “pono” instead of the standard pongo – Yo pongo este juguete en la mesa. saber:

### 2. Registers and Variety in Peninsular Spanish - William Hepner

**URL:** https://williamhepner.com/?p=5416

The registers of a language are a fascinating thing. Even the mere fact that registers exist is fascinating. And while everyone can recognize that the kind of language that we use as human beings varies with the circumstance—people don’t use the same vocabulary and phraseology in a courtroom as in a taxi or a supermarket—for the student of a foreign language, the importance of a grasp of multiple registers is often underplayed or overlooked. And even if they are nominally recognized, often enough the registers of a language are understood as implicit. This is probably fine for the native speaker, who doesn’t need to consciously understand very much at all. But the non-native speaker needs a more explicit understanding—not to mention that having a grasp of the registers of a foreign language can function as a benchmark for a student’s general proficiency and learning progress.

While considering some of the abilities of the advanced learner of a foreign language—and I take advanced here to mean the C-levels as defined by the CEFR, or roughly Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 4/ACTFL Superior/Distinguished according to the American system—and after reading large amounts of text and manuals from the above bodies and organizations, I’ve come to the conclusion that a learner’s most distinguishing trait at the advanced levels is that the linguistic repertoire includes an ability not only to comprehend the multiple registers of a language, but also to deploy them as needed. Knowledge and use of these registers also presupposes a certain amount of cultural knowledge embedded in the language in question, and there isn’t a truly advanced student of a foreign language who doesn’t have their knowledge of the language bound up with that of its culture. To know a language well is to know the culture of that language.... Keep in mind that by register I don’t mean dialect, but instead the designation of a kind of language common to a given social or cultural sphere, such as a low, formal, colloquial, or academic register. It is also worth mentioning that, as a student of a foreign language, being able to navigate multiple registers is not only an essential skill, but also the determinant of your flexibility in the language, your ability to blend in with the culture, to be native-like (and please disregard the inevitable controversy associated with the whole idea of being native, since it is beside the point here).

In conjunction with the ratings provided by the ILR, the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the United States brings up the following important hallmark of the Level 4 mentioned above in a self-appraisal checklist of speaking proficiency: “Are you able to alter your speech deliberately, depending upon whether you are talking to university professors, close friends, employees, etc.?” As I’ve been arguing here, this is not just one of the hallmarks but

*the* hallmark of an advanced learner.

That’s where the word variety comes in, and my notion of variety is that it encapsulates a strategy of long-term language learning: it is, in essence, learning from multiple registers over time and using these multiple registers as a pathway toward deepening your knowledge of a foreign language.... ### Some Different Registers of (Peninsular) Spanish

With that theory out of the way, I wanted to describe a brief list of registers in a single dialect of the Spanish language. I’ve made this list with the hope of uniting theory and practice so as to make my ideas more tangible.

Note that this list of Spanish registers is meant to be my particular application of the above ideas, and that I’ve created it from my own extensive but idiosyncratic experience with the Spanish language. That personal experience is why you’ll find that these examples draw on Peninsular Spanish and, in particular, the central or Castilian dialect found in Madrid.

As a final disclaimer, I’d like to say that this list is not exhaustive, and I’m not a professional linguist. I make no assertions of completeness. Instead, this list is my attempt at a general outline of a handful of registers in one dialect of the vast, sprawling, and beautifully florescent Spanish language. Also note that some of the character quotations from the sitcom mentioned here,

*Aquí no hay quien viva*, are paraphrases.

**Register 1**: Low Slang, Profanity, and an Endless Array of Vulgar Insults

In Madrid, this would be the language found in general currency among pretty much any group of native speakers, and even if the person in question isn’t inclined to use it, they would certainly understand it (and it wouldn’t necessarily be pleasing to the ear—though it could be hilarious). A perfect example would be the kind of language used by the portero Emilio in the Spanish series... *Aquí no hay quien viva*.

**Examples** of words and phrases in this register: *Que te den morcilla*, *me la suda*, *no me jodas*, *métetelo donde te quepa*, *a tomar por culo*, *me cago en la leche*, and words such as *guarra*, *golfa*, *chulo*, *maricón*, *julay*, and *tocapelotas*.

**Register 2**: Informal Language and Frequent Everyday Usages

This is the kind of language found in normal conversations if, for instance, you’re at the supermarket or talking among friends (most of the time). It also has a beautiful expressive range, from low insult (without dipping into the truly vulgar) to something eloquent and radiant, and everything in between. Most of the characters on

*Aquí no hay quien viva* use this kind of language most of the time.

**Examples** (just a few here at random, because this is a huge category): *No me he intentado escaquear de nada*, *se ha frotado las manos*, *se me ha ido de las manos*, *parece mentira que*, *se le ha ido la pinza/la olla*, *no se ha enterado de nada*, *ponerse en la piel de*, and *ponerse las pilas*.... **Register 3**: Elevated, Formal Language and Educated Usages

A good example of this would be the character Juan Cuesta in

*Aquí no hay quien viva*: he’s an aging schoolteacher, educated and articulate, almost never verbally vulgar, but the sitcom’s running gag is that he always uses this register as an integral and highly annoying part of his personality. In consequence, he comes off as a prig, pretentious, and generally unlikable. And very often brilliantly funny.

**Examples**: “ *¿Qué es lo que opinas sobre el papel que tiene China como potencia económica a nivel mundial?” “* *Impugno la junta.” *Looking at a chart explaining fetal development in a doctor’s office: *“Es una maravilla ver cómo el feto, en su desarrollo morfológico, empieza a dar sus primeros saltos vitales.”* “ *¿No sería mejor que soslayásemos las consecuencias de estos pequeños percances para llegar a un acuerdo mutuo?”*

**Register 4**: Academic and Literary Language

Registers four and five could be classified together because they both use a special and often highly formal, even fossilized register distinct from the day-to-day stuff found on television or while shopping, talking with friends, or having a family dinner. It is rarely, in other words, what’s found in your local pub.... **Examples**: Lots of field-specific terminology, the use of the relative adjective *cuyo* in uninterrupted speech patterns or constructions, some low-frequency connectors like *por mor de* or *de suerte que*, and a massive number of low-frequency verbs and set phrases such as *canícula*, *vilipendiar*, *escarabajear*, *proceloso*, *tiempo ha*, *dantesco*, *motu proprio* (a Latinism), and *fuero interno*.

**Register 5**: Ceremonial or Parliamentary Language

This is the register in which

*usted* occurs in the highest proportion. There are also formal, almost stilted usages backed by what are probably centuries of linguistic custom. This register is largely confined to formal speeches or arguments and rebuttals in parliamentary discussions.

**Examples**: Heavy use of *usted* (in fact, *tutear* would here be the exception), words of formal address and honorifics like *señoría*, and expressions such as * tener la palabra*. Common collocations like *enmiendas constitucionales* also show up, in addition to lots of hand-waving, microphones, and performative gestures meant for the public eye.... It goes without saying that there are more registers than the ones listed above, but the salient feature common to all is variety. A student’s ability to learn from the multiple registers of the target language—to get familiar with this variety and to continue exploring it—in large part determines their progress toward a varied and robust linguistic repertoire.

Variety, ultimately, is the most important factor in reaching advanced proficiency in a foreign language. Variety is also the greatest source of pleasure for the foreign-language student—like the variety found in a bottomless koi pond with a thousand whipping and multicolored tails. As with many other fields or bodies of knowledge, we never really finish learning a language, which will always be full of surprises for the curious and the persistent and the eternally young at heart.

### 3. A Reference Grammar of Spanish

**URL:** https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9780511921957_A23683463/preview-9780511921957_A23683463.pdf

any more than the Iberian “tú” form dominates in large parts of Argentina, but this does 
not mean that the inhabitants of these two countries speak different languages that are 
mutually unintelligible. Indeed, their discourse is remarkably similar.
A shift in emphasis on the appreciation of language and its assessment in the context 
of the written and the spoken word has taken place in recent years. It no longer behoves 
commentators of language to establish patterns and models according to which all expres-
sion is judged, or to provide a code of syntax or strict linguistic analysis, so that we should 
all uniformly write like Shakespeare or Cervantes or Racine. A grammar is no longer 
required to be prescriptive but rather to put before the public what most people agree 
upon. Encouraging us to speak like books is manifestly not an activity to be promoted.
The most conspicuous feature in the Spanish language is that, although any endeavor 
to embrace the Spanish of Colombia in the same context as that of Mexico, Argentina 
or Spain may appear futile, its grammar is broadly consistent and regular everywhere. 
The Mexican grammar of a Carlos Fuentes and an Octavio Paz may exhibit discrepancies 
from the Argentinian grammar of an Ernesto Sábato and a Borges, or the Colombian 
grammar of a Gabriel García Márquez, or the Iberian grammar of Carmen Martín Gaite 
and Cela, but the overall patterns are not dissimilar. Admittedly, the lexical aspects of 
these authors contain considerable divergences, but the grammatical structures that hold 
together their personal choice of words, patterns of imagery, metaphorical expression, 
sentence structure and so on, rest on homogeneous foundations. All the Spanish- speaking... sixteenth century lies in their retention of what in Spain nowadays would be considered 
archaisms or are used with a different or restricted meaning. Moreno de Alba provides a 
whole chapter on this issue (pp. 262–70).
It is unquestionably true that if grammatical dissimilarities do arise from an investi-
gation into the grammar models of the four countries concerned, these dissimilarities 
do not necessarily spring from a contrast between Spain and the Canary Islands and the 
Spanish American countries. Indeed, a telling illustration of this feature may be under-
lined by the Argentinian standard and, this we must accept, correct use of “adelante 
mío” (in front of me) and its varieties (adelante tuyo/suyo, etc.) eschewed by the speakers 
of the other three countries, who view it with scepticism as highly irregular and reject 
it without reservation. How can an adverb be juxtaposed in this way to a possessive 
pronoun? Nevertheless, “delante mío” (i.e. preposition and possessive pronoun) – a struc-
ture less familiar to Argentinian speakers – does creep into the colloquial language of 
Spain, Mexico and Colombia.
In numerous cases, however, the differences that do manifest themselves between the... xviii 
Introduction to the Spanish language
Likewise, prepositions and conjunctions provide rich seams of contrastive investigation. 
Yet again, Spanish America reveals a strong tendency to use certain intransitive verbs 
refl exively. “Amanecerse,” “regresarse,” “huirse,” “demorarse” (to delay), “pararse” (to 
stand up), “recibirse” (to graduate) and “dilatarse” (to delay) are very marked illustrations of 
Iberian archaisms that are still vigorously used in various parts of the Americas, notably, 
for our purposes, in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico (see Section 78.11. on foreign and 
indigenous terms for a fuller development of this theme). Finally, the apocopation of the 
feminine form of “primera” > “primer” that once existed in Renaissance Spain (la primer 
página/vez) still occurs in active form in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico.
Notwithstanding some pronounced divergences between the grammar of Spain and the 
Canary Islands and that of the various countries of Latin America, most Spanish- speakers 
reveal a consciousness of what is correct and incorrect Spanish. For instance, there exists... a consensus of opinion in the Spanish- speaking world with respect to the correctness of 
the simple sentence: “Vi a una chica mexicana ayer.” No one would dream of saying “mex-
icano” in this context, unless in jest or for some other unusual effect. Furthermore, there 
would be broad agreement on the use of the personal or distinctive “a” preceding “chica” 
(see Chapter 64 on the distinctive “a”). With respect to time, the preterit “Vi” attracted by 
the adverb of time “ayer” would elicit little disagreement anywhere. Of course, a Mexican 
speaker would probably say “chamaca” instead of “chica,” while a speaker from Spain 
would doubtless write “mejicana” instead of “mexicana,” a feature also most apparent, 
strangely enough, in Colombia, but not in Argentina. However, Iberian Spanish is slowly 
accommodating the “x” of Mexico – witness Manuel Seco’s note on the subject in his 
Diccionario de dudas. A Colombian speaker would not use “chica,” preferring “muchacha,” 
and so on. Of course, the point to stress here with reference to correctness is that, at any 
level of the register scale, Spanish- speakers will largely agree on the fundamental and... 4 
A Reference Grammar of Spanish
It must be stressed that these subdivisions are the result of an artifi cial division, and that 
the reality behind them consists of subtle, imperceptible shifts, not rigidly defi ned cat-
egories. We have confi ned these register divisions to three, as being more practicable to 
handle, although one could argue the case for more.
Looking towards the future, it is possible that some of what are deemed incorrect 
usages contained in R1 will become socially acceptable language. An excellent illustration

who doubtless would reject them. Of course, everyone would agree on the acceptabil-
ity of delante de mí, considering it as R2. Yet how many Spanish- speakers of standard 
Spanish would admit delante mío as R2? Probably none. It would fall into the category 
of R1. Finally, the formal ante mí would correspond to an R3 category. Yet all these four 
expressions have validity in their own way, according to circumstances, locality, region 
or country.
To note how these register categories vary, there follows a small compendium of 
examples illustrating how register is marked in the treatment of Spanish grammar in 
the present book. The categories R1 and R2 are mainly used here by way of illustration. 
It should be borne in mind that these are only rough indications, and that such divisions 
do not necessarily apply to all Spanish- speaking countries. (Many of these features will be 
treated more fully later in the text.)

In other words, the level of language we resort to depends, to a very large extent, on whether we are speaking with friends, which would attract a colloquial style or writing a letter or delivering a lecture involving a standard style or even a very formal register entailing an elevated type of expression. The levels of language may differ from informal to formal, and are deter- mined by four factors: sex, age, status and intimacy. All these factors affect, in varying degrees, the way we use language in areas of both vocabulary and grammar. Of course,... the present work is concerned exclusively with grammar, the use of which will be pre- sented in the context of register, when suitable and necessary. Register assignations as treated in this book will appear as either R1, R2 or R3. These subsections may be summa- rized in the following manner: extreme informality extreme formality R1 R2 R3 very informal, casual, colloquial, familiar, elliptical, grammatically unsound, repetitive, pleonastic standard, polite, educated, grammatically sound formal, literary, offi cial, language of scholars and purists, meticulously correct, reluctant to admit new grammatical structures www.cambridge.org © in this web service Cambridge University Press Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-42961-0 - A Reference Grammar of Spanish R.

It must be stressed that these subdivisions are the result of an artifi cial division, and that the reality behind them consists of subtle, imperceptible shifts, not rigidly defi ned cat- egories. We have confi ned these register divisions to three, as being more practicable to handle, although one could argue the case for more. Looking towards the future, it is possible that some of what are deemed incorrect usages contained in R1 will become socially acceptable language. An excellent illustration of this point is the previous reluctance of British English to admit different to or different than, American importations but now gaining credibility. Similarly, the former resistance of Iberian Spanish to the spelling México as it appears in the country of that name, as opposed to Méjico, has now faded. In point of fact, México now appears quite regularly in Spain. It is manifestly obvious that the fact that the Spanish language is spoken over vast... territories will inevitably entail grammatical diversity and even uncertainty, in the light of which what is acceptable in one Spanish- speaking country is unacceptable in another. One does, of course, need to examine what is meant by “correctness.” There are two senses in which a language is “correct.” The fi rst relates to a foreigner’s manipulation of the language. If what is said is unacceptable to a native speaker or writer in any register, then it is “incorrect.” The second is connected to a native speaker’s attitude to her/his own language, and this is a more complex matter. In the popular and educated mind, there exists a close association between “correct” and the standard language: features of local varieties and registers which differ from “standard” usage are deemed “incorrect,” even though they are used by native speakers. The Real Academia Española (RAE) was... once recognized as the guardian of the “correctness” of Spanish, but this is no longer the case (see note 2 in the introduction, p. xvii). There are as many academias as there are Spanish- speaking countries, and they all enjoy linguistic parity, and the judgment of correctness has in many cases become arbitrary. An Argentinian would fi nd the juxtaposi- tion of adverb and possessive pronoun adelante mío (in front of me), cerca tuyo (near you) perfectly admissible and would therefore classify them as R2, but these expressions would be considered strange by a Colombian, a Mexican or a speaker from the Iberian Peninsula, who doubtless would reject them. Of course, everyone would agree on the acceptabil- ity of delante de mí, considering it as R2. Yet how many Spanish- speakers of standard Spanish would admit delante mío as R2? Probably none. It would fall into the category... of R1. Finally, the formal ante mí would correspond to an R3 category. Yet all these four expressions have validity in their own way, according to circumstances, locality, region or country. To note how these register categories vary, there follows a small compendium of examples illustrating how register is marked in the treatment of Spanish grammar in the present book. The categories R1 and R2 are mainly used here by way of illustration. It should be borne in mind that these are only rough indications, and that such divisions do not necessarily apply to all Spanish- speaking countries. (Many of these features will be treated more fully later in the text.)

In Spanish America (A, C and M, for instance, and all well attested), as well as in Spain, children, particularly young ones, and some adults, will readily say andé and andó instead of the standard anduve and anduvo (See Seco, Diccionario de dudas on andar), with repercussions for the imperfect subjunctive: andara, andaras, etc.... Preterits are in fact especially subject to regularization. Thus, chil- dren will say cabí (= cupe, from caber), conducí (= conduje, from conducir), podí (= pude, from poder), poní (= puse, from poner), satisfací (= satisfi ce, from satisfacer), traí (= traje, from traer) and vení (= vine, from venir). Needless to add, verbal regularization with children has its equivalent in English with, for example, she felled down, he caughted the ball. The present tenses of the following verbs are prone to confusion: caber: “cabo” instead of the standard quepo – No quepo aquí. (There’s no room for me here.) oír: “oyo” instead of the standard oigo – No te oigo. poner: “pono” instead of the standard pongo – Yo pongo este juguete en la mesa. saber:

### 5. Registers and Variety in Peninsular Spanish - William Hepner

**URL:** https://williamhepner.com/?p=5416

The registers of a language are a fascinating thing. Even the mere fact that registers exist is fascinating. And while everyone can recognize that the kind of language that we use as human beings varies with the circumstance—people don’t use the same vocabulary and phraseology in a courtroom as in a taxi or a supermarket—for the student of a foreign language, the importance of a grasp of multiple registers is often underplayed or overlooked. And even if they are nominally recognized, often enough the registers of a language are understood as implicit. This is probably fine for the native speaker, who doesn’t need to consciously understand very much at all. But the non-native speaker needs a more explicit understanding—not to mention that having a grasp of the registers of a foreign language can function as a benchmark for a student’s general proficiency and learning progress.

While considering some of the abilities of the advanced learner of a foreign language—and I take advanced here to mean the C-levels as defined by the CEFR, or roughly Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 4/ACTFL Superior/Distinguished according to the American system—and after reading large amounts of text and manuals from the above bodies and organizations, I’ve come to the conclusion that a learner’s most distinguishing trait at the advanced levels is that the linguistic repertoire includes an ability not only to comprehend the multiple registers of a language, but also to deploy them as needed. Knowledge and use of these registers also presupposes a certain amount of cultural knowledge embedded in the language in question, and there isn’t a truly advanced student of a foreign language who doesn’t have their knowledge of the language bound up with that of its culture. To know a language well is to know the culture of that language.... Keep in mind that by register I don’t mean dialect, but instead the designation of a kind of language common to a given social or cultural sphere, such as a low, formal, colloquial, or academic register. It is also worth mentioning that, as a student of a foreign language, being able to navigate multiple registers is not only an essential skill, but also the determinant of your flexibility in the language, your ability to blend in with the culture, to be native-like (and please disregard the inevitable controversy associated with the whole idea of being native, since it is beside the point here).

In conjunction with the ratings provided by the ILR, the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the United States brings up the following important hallmark of the Level 4 mentioned above in a self-appraisal checklist of speaking proficiency: “Are you able to alter your speech deliberately, depending upon whether you are talking to university professors, close friends, employees, etc.?” As I’ve been arguing here, this is not just one of the hallmarks but

*the* hallmark of an advanced learner.

That’s where the word variety comes in, and my notion of variety is that it encapsulates a strategy of long-term language learning: it is, in essence, learning from multiple registers over time and using these multiple registers as a pathway toward deepening your knowledge of a foreign language.... ### Some Different Registers of (Peninsular) Spanish

With that theory out of the way, I wanted to describe a brief list of registers in a single dialect of the Spanish language. I’ve made this list with the hope of uniting theory and practice so as to make my ideas more tangible.

Note that this list of Spanish registers is meant to be my particular application of the above ideas, and that I’ve created it from my own extensive but idiosyncratic experience with the Spanish language. That personal experience is why you’ll find that these examples draw on Peninsular Spanish and, in particular, the central or Castilian dialect found in Madrid.

As a final disclaimer, I’d like to say that this list is not exhaustive, and I’m not a professional linguist. I make no assertions of completeness. Instead, this list is my attempt at a general outline of a handful of registers in one dialect of the vast, sprawling, and beautifully florescent Spanish language. Also note that some of the character quotations from the sitcom mentioned here,

*Aquí no hay quien viva*, are paraphrases.

**Register 1**: Low Slang, Profanity, and an Endless Array of Vulgar Insults

In Madrid, this would be the language found in general currency among pretty much any group of native speakers, and even if the person in question isn’t inclined to use it, they would certainly understand it (and it wouldn’t necessarily be pleasing to the ear—though it could be hilarious). A perfect example would be the kind of language used by the portero Emilio in the Spanish series... *Aquí no hay quien viva*.

**Examples** of words and phrases in this register: *Que te den morcilla*, *me la suda*, *no me jodas*, *métetelo donde te quepa*, *a tomar por culo*, *me cago en la leche*, and words such as *guarra*, *golfa*, *chulo*, *maricón*, *julay*, and *tocapelotas*.

**Register 2**: Informal Language and Frequent Everyday Usages

This is the kind of language found in normal conversations if, for instance, you’re at the supermarket or talking among friends (most of the time). It also has a beautiful expressive range, from low insult (without dipping into the truly vulgar) to something eloquent and radiant, and everything in between. Most of the characters on

*Aquí no hay quien viva* use this kind of language most of the time.

**Examples** (just a few here at random, because this is a huge category): *No me he intentado escaquear de nada*, *se ha frotado las manos*, *se me ha ido de las manos*, *parece mentira que*, *se le ha ido la pinza/la olla*, *no se ha enterado de nada*, *ponerse en la piel de*, and *ponerse las pilas*.... **Register 3**: Elevated, Formal Language and Educated Usages

A good example of this would be the character Juan Cuesta in

*Aquí no hay quien viva*: he’s an aging schoolteacher, educated and articulate, almost never verbally vulgar, but the sitcom’s running gag is that he always uses this register as an integral and highly annoying part of his personality. In consequence, he comes off as a prig, pretentious, and generally unlikable. And very often brilliantly funny.

**Examples**: “ *¿Qué es lo que opinas sobre el papel que tiene China como potencia económica a nivel mundial?” “* *Impugno la junta.” *Looking at a chart explaining fetal development in a doctor’s office: *“Es una maravilla ver cómo el feto, en su desarrollo morfológico, empieza a dar sus primeros saltos vitales.”* “ *¿No sería mejor que soslayásemos las consecuencias de estos pequeños percances para llegar a un acuerdo mutuo?”*

**Register 4**: Academic and Literary Language

Registers four and five could be classified together because they both use a special and often highly formal, even fossilized register distinct from the day-to-day stuff found on television or while shopping, talking with friends, or having a family dinner. It is rarely, in other words, what’s found in your local pub.... **Examples**: Lots of field-specific terminology, the use of the relative adjective *cuyo* in uninterrupted speech patterns or constructions, some low-frequency connectors like *por mor de* or *de suerte que*, and a massive number of low-frequency verbs and set phrases such as *canícula*, *vilipendiar*, *escarabajear*, *proceloso*, *tiempo ha*, *dantesco*, *motu proprio* (a Latinism), and *fuero interno*.

**Register 5**: Ceremonial or Parliamentary Language

This is the register in which

*usted* occurs in the highest proportion. There are also formal, almost stilted usages backed by what are probably centuries of linguistic custom. This register is largely confined to formal speeches or arguments and rebuttals in parliamentary discussions.

**Examples**: Heavy use of *usted* (in fact, *tutear* would here be the exception), words of formal address and honorifics like *señoría*, and expressions such as * tener la palabra*. Common collocations like *enmiendas constitucionales* also show up, in addition to lots of hand-waving, microphones, and performative gestures meant for the public eye.... It goes without saying that there are more registers than the ones listed above, but the salient feature common to all is variety. A student’s ability to learn from the multiple registers of the target language—to get familiar with this variety and to continue exploring it—in large part determines their progress toward a varied and robust linguistic repertoire.

Variety, ultimately, is the most important factor in reaching advanced proficiency in a foreign language. Variety is also the greatest source of pleasure for the foreign-language student—like the variety found in a bottomless koi pond with a thousand whipping and multicolored tails. As with many other fields or bodies of knowledge, we never really finish learning a language, which will always be full of surprises for the curious and the persistent and the eternally young at heart.
