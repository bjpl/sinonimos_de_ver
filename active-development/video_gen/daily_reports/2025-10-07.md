## üìä Metrics

**Test Status:**
- Starting: 474 passing, 79% coverage
- Ending: 475 passing, 79% coverage (+1 test)

**Code Changes:**
- Commits: 9
- Files modified: ~10 (mostly docs and CLAUDE.md)
- Lines changed: ~500 (documentation updates)

**Documentation:**
- CLAUDE.md: Significantly enhanced with 25 directives
- Test files: Fixed compatibility issues
- Generated outputs: Cleaned up

---

## üí° Key Learnings

**Session Type:**
- This was intentionally a "maintenance day" following Oct 6's 48-commit marathon
- Focus on polish, cleanup, and process improvement rather than new features
- Important to have these consolidation days after major feature work

**CLAUDE.md Improvements:**
- Clear agent operating instructions reduce errors and improve consistency
- Professional communication guidelines help maintain appropriate tone
- Swarm orchestration clarity prevents confusion about MCP vs Task tool roles

**Test Suite Health:**
- Maintaining 0 failures is critical for confidence
- 128 skipped tests are mostly legitimate (slow/server tests)
- ~30-35 skipped tests need refactoring (documented for future work)

---

## üìù Next Session Priorities

**Suggested for Oct 9+:**
1. **Test Debt Reduction** - Refactor 25-35 API-changed tests (3-4 hours)
2. **Remove Dead Code** - Delete unused files with 0% coverage (1 hour)
3. **AI Enhancement** - Implement enhanced prompts from plan (2-3 hours)
4. **Issue Tracker** - Create formal ISSUES.md for tracking (30 min)

**Or Alternative:**
- Begin new feature development (AI enhancements, new scene types, etc.)
- Performance optimization work
- Web UI improvements

---

## üéØ Session Assessment

**What Went Well:**
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (zero failures)
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md significantly improved
- ‚úÖ Clean, organized codebase ready for next sprint
- ‚úÖ Good documentation of processes and guidelines

**Challenges:**
- None significant - smooth maintenance session

**Momentum:**
- Following Oct 6's massive productivity (48 commits), this was appropriate cooldown
- Positioned well for next major development sprint
- Technical debt is documented and manageable

---

**Session End:** Evening, October 7, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Excellent - System stable, documented, ready for next phase

*Completed retroactively on October 9, 2025 as part of daily report audit*
