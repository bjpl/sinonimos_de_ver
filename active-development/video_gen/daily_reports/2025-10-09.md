### Before

- Tests: 475 passing, 128 skipped (20.9%)
- Coverage: 79%
- Failures: 0

### After

- Tests: 475 passing, 120 skipped (19.6%)

- All actual tests verified working
- No regressions introduced
- AI enhancements tested (4/4 passing)

---

### Process Learnings

**Parallel Review is Powerful:**
- 4 agents found 22 issues in 3 hours
- Would have taken 10-12 hours sequentially
- Diverse perspectives caught more issues
- Each agent specialized in domain

**Fix-As-You-Go Prevents Debt:**
- Found bugs during review
- Fixed immediately (45 min turnaround)
- Prevented technical debt accumulation
- Maintained momentum

**Systematic Review Catches Subtle Bugs:**
- AI bugs were subtle (wrong attribute, validation edge case)
- Security issue was hidden in legacy script
- Would have reached production without review
- Code review by AI agents is effective

### Technical Learnings

**AI Implementation:**
- Scene-position context significantly improves quality
- Quality validation is essential (prevents bad outputs)
- Cost tracking provides accountability
- Metrics must be counted AFTER validation, not before

**Security:**
- `os.system()` is dangerous (always use subprocess)
- Input validation is critical (path traversal, SSRF)
- Length limits prevent DoS
- Security testing is non-existent (0 tests) - need to add

**Architecture:**
- Dual adapter systems create maintenance burden
- Exception file duplication causes confusion
- Pipeline design is solid (few issues found)
- Resume capability is robust

---

### About Plans A+B

- Both plans were correctly scoped (completed in estimated time)
- Plan A provided clean foundation for Plan B
- AI enhancements went smoothly (until review found bugs)
- Combining plans in one day is achievable

### About Systematic Review

- Parallel agents are highly effective
- Finding bugs in fresh code is valuable (catch early)
- Security audits find critical issues
- Review time well spent (prevented production bugs)

### About the Codebase

- Pipeline architecture is professional-grade
- Dual adapter systems are historical artifact (need cleanup)
- Security wasn't prioritized initially (gaps found)
- Test coverage is good but error paths weak

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Process Learnings

**Parallel Review is Powerful:**
- 4 agents found 22 issues in 3 hours
- Would have taken 10-12 hours sequentially
- Diverse perspectives caught more issues
- Each agent specialized in domain

**Fix-As-You-Go Prevents Debt:**
- Found bugs during review
- Fixed immediately (45 min turnaround)
- Prevented technical debt accumulation
- Maintained momentum

**Systematic Review Catches Subtle Bugs:**
- AI bugs were subtle (wrong attribute, validation edge case)
- Security issue was hidden in legacy script
- Would have reached production without review
- Code review by AI agents is effective

### Technical Learnings

**AI Implementation:**
- Scene-position context significantly improves quality
- Quality validation is essential (prevents bad outputs)
- Cost tracking provides accountability
- Metrics must be counted AFTER validation, not before

**Security:**
- `os.system()` is dangerous (always use subprocess)
- Input validation is critical (path traversal, SSRF)
- Length limits prevent DoS
- Security testing is non-existent (0 tests) - need to add

**Architecture:**
- Dual adapter systems create maintenance burden
- Exception file duplication causes confusion
- Pipeline design is solid (few issues found)
- Resume capability is robust
