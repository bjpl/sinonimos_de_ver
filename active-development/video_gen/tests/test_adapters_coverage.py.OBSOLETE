"""
OBSOLETE TEST FILE - DO NOT USE
=================================

This test file tests the deprecated app.input_adapters.examples module
which was removed during input adapter consolidation.

Status: DEPRECATED - Removed 2025-10-11
Reason: Tests code that no longer exists (app/input_adapters/examples.py)

The example functions tested here:
- example_document_adapter()
- example_yaml_adapter()
- example_programmatic_adapter()
- example_factory_pattern()
- example_export_workflow()
- example_custom_adapter()
- run_all_examples()

These were removed as part of consolidating input adapters from:
  app/input_adapters/* â†’ video_gen/input_adapters/*

TODO: Rewrite these tests for the new video_gen.input_adapters API
      or create new example adapters if needed for testing.

See: docs/architecture/ADR_001_INPUT_ADAPTER_CONSOLIDATION.md
