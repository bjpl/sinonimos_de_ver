# 🔧 AI Prompt Improvements - Technical vs Marketing

**Problem Identified:** AI narration was too marketing-focused
**Solution Implemented:** Updated prompts for technical/educational tone

---

## ❌ Before (Marketing-Heavy)

### **Old Prompt Guidance:**
```
Style: Professional, welcoming, clear.
Style: Educational, clear, encouraging.
Style: Clear, organized, professional.
```

### **Old Narration Examples:**

**Title scene:**
> "Transform any content into professional videos instantly with Video Gen."

**List scene:**
> "Video Gen is a comprehensive production system designed for creating professional-quality videos efficiently. Let's explore the key features that make this platform so powerful."

**Outro:**
> "Your journey to professional video creation starts here. Check out GETTING_STARTED.md to begin transforming your ideas into compelling visual stories today."

**Problems:**
- ❌ "Transform", "instantly", "powerful" (marketing buzzwords)
- ❌ "Journey", "compelling" (sales language)
- ❌ "Let's explore" (overly conversational)
- ❌ Sounds like a product pitch, not documentation

---

## ✅ After (Technical/Educational)

### **New Prompt Guidance:**
```
Style: Technical, factual, educational - NOT marketing/sales language.
Avoid: "powerful", "amazing", "transform", "instantly", "revolutionary"
Tone: Like explaining to a developer colleague, not selling a product.

Avoid these marketing words:
- "powerful", "amazing", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- "transform", "unleash", "empower", "elevate"
- "journey", "explore", "discover" (unless literally exploring)
- Excessive adjectives and adverbs

Use instead:
- Direct descriptions of functionality
- Technical accuracy
- Factual benefits
- Straightforward explanations
```

### **New Narration Examples:**

**Title scene:**
> "Video Gen is a system for creating videos from documents, YouTube transcripts, or structured input."

**List scene:**
> "The system provides three input methods for different workflows. It supports six scene types for various content structures. Four neural TTS voices are available for narration. Audio synchronization uses duration-first architecture."

**Outro:**
> "See getting started dot M D for installation and usage instructions."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Direct, factual statements
- ✅ Technical precision
- ✅ No marketing language
- ✅ Sounds like documentation, not sales

## 🔧 Key Changes

### **1. Temperature Reduced:**
```python
# Before
temperature=0.7  # More creative, varied

# After
temperature=0.5  # More consistent, factual
```

### **2. Explicit Anti-Marketing Instructions:**

**Added to ALL prompts:**
```
- Technical documentation tone (NOT marketing/promotional)
- Clear, direct language (avoid hype and superlatives)
- No filler words or marketing buzzwords
- Like explaining to a developer colleague
```

### **3. Blacklist of Marketing Words:**

```
Avoid:
- "powerful", "amazing", "revolutionary"
- "transform", "unleash", "empower"
- "journey", "explore" (unless literal)
- Excessive adjectives
```

### **4. Positive Technical Language:**

```
Use instead:
- Direct descriptions of functionality
- Technical accuracy
- Factual benefits
- Straightforward explanations
```

## 📊 Comparison by Scene Type

### **Title Scenes:**

**Before:**
> "Transform any content into professional videos instantly"

**After:**
> "Video Gen creates videos from documents, transcripts, or structured input"

**Difference:** Factual description vs sales pitch

---

### **Command Scenes:**

**Before:**
> "Watch how just five simple commands can generate professional video content automatically. Run these commands in sequence and see immediate, high-quality results with minimal effort required."

**After:**
> "These commands parse input, generate narration, create audio with TTS, and encode video with GPU acceleration. The workflow handles synchronization automatically."

**Difference:** What it does vs how amazing it is

---

### **List Scenes:**

**Before:**
> "Let's explore the key features that make this platform so powerful. The system offers three flexible input methods to accommodate different workflow preferences..."

**After:**
> "The system includes three input methods. Document parser extracts structure from markdown. YouTube fetcher summarizes video transcripts. Interactive wizard guides manual creation."

**Difference:** Technical specification vs feature marketing

---

### **Outro Scenes:**

**Before:**
> "Your journey to professional video creation starts here. Check out GETTING_STARTED.md to begin transforming your ideas into compelling visual stories today."

**After:**
> "See getting started dot M D for installation steps and usage examples."

**Difference:** Practical pointer vs motivational close

---

## 🎯 Target Tone Examples

### **Good (Technical/Educational):**

✅ "This function parses markdown structure and extracts headings"
✅ "The audio-first architecture measures TTS duration before video generation"
✅ "Six scene types cover title slides, code examples, lists, comparisons, quotes, and closing screens"
✅ "Run these commands in sequence to generate output"

### **Bad (Marketing/Sales):**

❌ "Unleash the power of automated video creation"
❌ "Transform your documentation into compelling visual stories"
❌ "Experience lightning-fast video generation"
❌ "Revolutionary AI-powered workflow"
