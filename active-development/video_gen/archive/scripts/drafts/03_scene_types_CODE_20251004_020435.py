First, the Title scene establishes your topic and sets professional expectations. Command scenes demonstrate specific actions or instructions with clear visual focus. List scenes, like this one, organize multiple related concepts for easy comprehension.

Outro scenes provide strong conclusions and clear next steps for your audience. Code Comparison scenes highlight differences between approaches, making complex technical concepts immediately understandable.

Each scene type serves a specific purpose in technical storytelling. By strategically combining these layouts, you'll create content that's both informative and visually compelling, keeping your audience engaged throughout your entire presentation",
