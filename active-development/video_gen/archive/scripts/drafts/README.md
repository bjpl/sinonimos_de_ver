### File Categories

**Video 01 - Introduction (4 iterations)**
- `01_video_gen_intro_CODE_20251004_*.py` - Code drafts

## Reason for Archival

These files represent intermediate development states that were superseded by finalized versions. No active references to these files exist in the codebase, making them safe to archive for historical reference while reducing repository clutter.

## Restoration

If any of these files need to be restored, they can be moved back to `scripts/drafts/` or referenced directly from this archive location.
