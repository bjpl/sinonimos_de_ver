## Scene 2: scene_02 (LIST)

**Duration:** 3.0s - 15.0s (estimated: 50.7s)
**Voice:** female

**Narration:**
> "Technical content requires specific visual layouts to communicate information effectively. These six scene types provide the structural foundation for clear documentation presentation.

The title scene establishes context and introduces the main topic or section. Command scenes demonstrate specific instructions or procedures that users need to execute. List scenes organize related items or concepts in a structured, scannable format. Outro scenes provide closure and transition to subsequent content sections. Code comparison scenes display multiple code examples side by side for direct analysis. Each scene type serves a distinct function in technical communication, allowing content creators to match visual structure to information purpose. Proper scene selection ensures documentation remains accessible and logically organized for technical audiences."

## Scene 5: scene_05 (COMMAND)

**Duration:** 3.0s - 15.0s (estimated: 56.0s)
**Voice:** male

**Narration:**
> "YAML scene types define different content structures for your input files. Each scene type contains specific required and optional fields that determine how content gets processed.

You can mix multiple scene types within a single YAML file. The processor identifies each type by its designated field structure and applies the appropriate parsing logic.

Command scenes require action and target fields. Dialog scenes need speaker and text parameters. Narrative scenes use description fields for contextual content.

Scene type validation occurs during file parsing. Invalid field combinations trigger error messages with specific correction guidance. This prevents runtime failures during content generation.

Auto-generated narration pulls from scene metadata when text fields are empty. The system creates appropriate transitions between different scene types to maintain content flow consistency.
