Three Input Methods allow content submission through text entry, script upload, or API integration. Each method processes the input data and converts it into the system's internal format for video generation.

Six Scene Types define the visual layout and presentation structure of the generated video. These templates include presentation slides, talking head format, screen recording overlay, split screen, full screen graphics, and picture-in-picture configurations.

Four Professional Voices provide narration options with different vocal characteristics and speaking styles. The voice synthesis engine generates audio tracks that match the input text with consistent pronunciation and pacing.
