## Purpose of ADRs

Architecture Decision Records document **why** we made key technical decisions, not just **what** we built. They help:

- **Onboard new developers** - Understand rationale behind design choices
- **Prevent rework** - Avoid revisiting settled decisions
- **Learn from experience** - Document what worked and what didn't
- **Maintain consistency** - Establish patterns for similar problems
- **Track evolution** - See how architecture evolved over time

**Status:** In Progress (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 underway)

**Key Points:**
- Eliminates 3,600 lines of duplicate code
- Compatibility layer provides migration path
- 30-40% velocity improvement expected
- 12-15 day migration effort

**Links:**

### ADR-002: Modular Renderer System Design

**Problem:** How to organize 12+ scene renderers with shared utilities
**Decision:** Modular function-based renderers with base utilities
**Status:** Accepted (Implemented and tested)

**Key Points:**
- 7 renderer modules (basic, educational, checkpoint, comparison, etc.)
- 100% test coverage (142 tests)
- Function-based approach (no OOP overhead)
- Consistent styling via constants module
- Average 50-80ms frame generation time

**Architecture:**
```
video_gen/renderers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.py              # Shared utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.py         # Styling constants

**Status:** Accepted (Implemented with Plan B enhancements)

**Key Points:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 chosen over GPT-4 (better technical accuracy)
- Scene-position aware prompts (opening/middle/closing)
- Cost tracking and validation ($0.05-0.15 per video)
- Graceful fallback to original narration
- +34% engagement improvement (human evaluation)

**Enhancement Flow:**

### ADR-004: Testing Strategy and Organization

**Problem:** Mix of sync/async code, slow tests blocking development
**Decision:** Multi-tier testing with pytest markers
**Status:** Accepted (79% coverage achieved)

**Key Points:**
- Three test tiers: unit, integration, slow (E2E)
- pytest markers for filtering (`-m "not slow"`)
- pytest-asyncio for async testing
- 30s fast test runs, 5min full suite
- 475 passing tests, 128 intentionally skipped

**Test Organization:**
- **Unit tests** (< 0.1s) - Fast, isolated, mocked I/O
- **Integration tests** (< 2s) - Component interactions
- **Slow tests** (> 5s) - End-to-end workflows

**Coverage by Module:**
- Renderers: 100% (142 tests)
- Input Adapters: 85% (132 tests)
- Pipeline: 78% (86 tests)
- Overall: 79%

---

### ADR-005: Configuration System Design

**Problem:** Configuration scattered across files, hardcoded values
**Decision:** Singleton config class with environment variables
**Status:** Accepted (Implemented)

**Key Points:**
- Single source of truth (video_gen/shared/config.py)
- Environment variable support (.env file)
- API keys from environment only (security)
- Cross-platform path detection (FFmpeg auto-discovery)
- Follows 12-factor app principles

**Configuration Categories:**
- Paths: Base directories, output locations
- Video: Dimensions (1920x1080), FPS (30)
- External Tools: FFmpeg path (auto-detected)
- API Keys: Anthropic, OpenAI, YouTube
- Presets: Voice configs, color palettes
- Performance: Worker counts, memory limits

**Usage:**
```python
from video_gen.shared.config import config

output_path = config.output_dir / "video.mp4"
api_key = config.get_api_key("anthropic")
voice = config.get_voice("male")
color = config.get_color("blue")
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### How ADRs Relate to Each Other

**Configuration ‚Üí All Systems**
- ADR-005 provides config foundation
- Used by renderers (ADR-002) for styling
- Used by AI integration (ADR-003) for API keys
- Used by tests (ADR-004) for mocking

**Testing ‚Üí All Development**
- ADR-004 establishes test patterns
- Applied to renderers (ADR-002): 100% coverage
- Applied to adapters (ADR-001): migration validation
- Applied to AI (ADR-003): API mocking

**Modularity Pattern (Repeated)**
- ADR-001: Modular adapters
- ADR-002: Modular renderers
- Both follow similar principles:
  - Function-based approach
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Standardized interfaces
  - High test coverage

**Async/Await Pattern (Consistent)**
- ADR-001: Async adapters
- ADR-003: Async AI enhancement
- ADR-004: Async testing patterns
- Consistent async-first design

---

## Decision-Making Process

### How We Make Architecture Decisions

1. **Identify Problem**: Document pain points and requirements
2. **Research Alternatives**: Evaluate 3-5 options with pros/cons
3. **Prototype (if needed)**: Build small proofs-of-concept
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR with full rationale
5. **Implement**: Build according to ADR
6. **Validate**: Measure against success criteria
7. **Review**: Periodic review (quarterly or as needed)

### When to Create an ADR

‚úÖ **Create ADR for:**
- Major architectural decisions (frameworks, databases)
- Design patterns affecting multiple modules
- Significant trade-offs (performance vs. simplicity)
- Technology selection (AI model, testing framework)
- Breaking changes to public APIs

‚ùå **Don't create ADR for:**
- Minor implementation details
- Obvious choices (use Python for Python project)
- Reversible decisions easily changed
- Internal refactoring (unless teaching moment)

### ADR Lifecycle

**Proposed** ‚Üí Under consideration, seeking feedback
**Accepted** ‚Üí Approved and implemented
**Deprecated** ‚Üí Superseded by newer decision
**Rejected** ‚Üí Considered but not adopted
**Superseded** ‚Üí Replaced by specific other ADR

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

‚úÖ **Function-based over OOP (ADR-002)**
- Simpler to understand and test
- No overhead from instantiation
- Natural for stateless operations
- Easy to compose

‚úÖ **Async-first design (ADR-001, ADR-003)**
- Matches I/O-bound operations
- Better for scalability
- Modern Python idiom
- Testable with pytest-asyncio

‚úÖ **Environment variables for config (ADR-005)**
- Secure (no secrets in code)
- Flexible (easy to override)
- Cloud-native friendly
- Standard practice

‚úÖ **Multi-tier testing (ADR-004)**
- Fast feedback in development
- Comprehensive coverage in CI
- Clear test organization
- Flexible filtering

### What We'd Do Differently

‚ö†Ô∏è **Earlier API consolidation (ADR-001)**
- Duplication accumulated technical debt
- Should have unified sooner
- Lesson: Consolidate early, before duplication grows

‚ö†Ô∏è **More upfront planning for async (ADR-001)**
- Sync‚Üíasync migration is complex
- Should have started async from beginning
- Lesson: Design for async from day one

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pydantic for config validation (ADR-005)**
- Manual validation is tedious
- Pydantic would provide better type safety
- Lesson: Consider stronger validation libraries
