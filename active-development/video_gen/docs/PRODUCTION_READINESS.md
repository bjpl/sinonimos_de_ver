---

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work (Not Ready)

### 1. H2 Document Splitting ‚úÖ FIXED (Oct 6, 2025)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **NOW WORKING**

**What Was Fixed:**
- Updated merge logic in `video_gen/input_adapters/document.py`
- When `split_by_h2=True`, creates one video per H2 section
- Test now passing: `test_split_by_h2_headings`

**Usage:**
```python
InputConfig(
    input_type="document",
    source="document.md",
    split_by_h2=True  # Creates multiple videos
)
```

**Test Evidence:**
- Test: `test_document_adapter_enhanced.py::test_split_by_h2_headings`
- Status: ‚úÖ PASSING
- Result: Creates 3+ videos from document with 3 H2 sections

### 2. Web UI Integration (Partial coverage)

**Status**: ‚õî **NO AUTOMATED TESTING**

**What's Missing:**
- Zero automated tests for FastAPI endpoints
- No UI component testing
- Integration tests failing (TestClient compatibility issues)

**Evidence:**
```
ERROR tests/test_integration.py::test_health_check
TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'
```

**Impact**: Web UI may break without detection

**Fix Required**:
1. Fix TestClient compatibility (httpx version issue)
2. Add 50+ endpoint tests
3. Add UI component tests
4. Integration test suite for complete workflows

### 3. Auto-Orchestrator (129 skipped tests)

**Status**: ‚õî **INTEGRATION TESTS SKIPPED**

**What's Missing:**
- Server dependency tests skipped
- API endpoint tests incomplete
- Voice array handling untested

**Evidence:**
- `test_auto_orchestrator.py`: "Needs running server" (5 tests skipped)
- `test_api_voice_arrays.py`: Marked as skip
- `test_api_validation.py`: Integration tests deferred

**Impact**: Auto-orchestrator may fail in production environment

**Fix Required**:
1. Set up test server infrastructure
2. Mock API dependencies properly
3. Unskip and fix 129 deferred tests

### 4. Enhanced Document Adapter (Limited Testing)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY TESTED**

**What's Missing:**
- Nested lists edge cases
- Complex markdown tables
- Multi-format document handling
- Large file performance

**Evidence:**
- `test_document_adapter_enhanced.py` exists but limited scope
- No stress testing for large documents
- Edge cases not comprehensively covered

**Impact**: Complex documents may fail parsing

**Fix Required**:
1. Add 30+ edge case tests
2. Performance benchmarks for large files
3. Fuzzing for malformed input

## üìù Conclusion

**Bottom Line**: The video generation system has a **solid, production-ready core** (79% coverage, 452 passing tests) but **incomplete advanced features** (H2 splitting broken, 129 tests skipped, web UI untested).

**Deployment Strategy**:
- ‚úÖ **Deploy core API now** - High confidence in stability
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Hold H2 splitting** - Complete implementation first
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Hold web UI** - Fix tests before deployment
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Hold auto-orchestrator** - Unskip and validate tests

**Path to Full Production**:
1. Complete H2 splitting (1-2 days)
2. Unskip and fix 129 tests (2-3 days)
3. Fix web UI testing (2-3 days)
4. Integration validation (1 week)
5. Performance optimization (1-2 weeks)

**Confidence Level**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** for core features, **LOW** for advanced features
