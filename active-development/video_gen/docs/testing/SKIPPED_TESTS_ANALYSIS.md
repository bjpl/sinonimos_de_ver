# Skipped Tests Analysis - 128 Tests

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-06
**Total Skipped:** 128 tests (out of 612 total)
**Skip Rate:** 20.9%

---

## 📊 Skip Reasons Categorized

### ✅ **Category 1: Legitimate Skips (Server Required)** - ~40 tests

**Reason:** Tests require web server running

**Tests:**
- `test_api_voice_arrays.py` (4 tests) - API endpoint tests
- `test_web_ui_integration.py` (multiple tests) - Web UI tests
- `test_input_adapters_integration.py` (server-dependent tests)

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - These should be skipped in fast test runs
**Action:** None needed - working as intended

**How to run:**
```bash
# Start server first
python app/main.py &

# Then run API tests
pytest tests/test_api_voice_arrays.py tests/test_web_ui_integration.py
```

---

### ⚠️ **Category 2: API Changes (Need Refactoring)** - ~25 tests

**Reason:** Tests written for old API that was refactored

**Tests:**
- `test_auto_orchestrator.py` (3 tests) - PipelineOrchestrator API changed
- `test_input_adapters_integration.py` (YouTube tests) - API changed from requests to youtube_transcript_api
- `test_input_adapters_integration.py` (Programmatic tests) - Adapter expects string, not VideoConfig

**Skip Markers:**
- "PipelineOrchestrator API changed - needs refactoring"
- "YouTube adapter uses youtube_transcript_api not requests"
- "ProgrammaticAdapter expects string source"

**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS WORK** - Tests are outdated
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 3-4 hours to update tests to new API

**Action Required:**
- Update test expectations to match current API
- Use correct import paths
- Update mocking strategies

---

### 🔄 **Category 3: Recently Fixed (Marked Skip During Fixes)** - ~10 tests

**Reason:** Temporarily skipped while fixing other issues

**Tests:**
- H2 splitting test - **NOW FIXED** (was skipped, now passes)
- Parallel generation test - Mock limitation
- Some adapter tests - Linter issues during fixing

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - H2 test now passing
**Action:** Remove skip markers where tests now work

---

### 🎯 **Category 4: Slow/Integration Tests** - ~50 tests

**Reason:** Marked as "slow" - excluded by default in fast runs

**Tests:**
- End-to-end pipeline tests
- Full video generation tests
- Integration tests requiring external resources

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Intentionally excluded for fast CI/CD
**Action:** None - run with `pytest -m slow` when needed

**How to run:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -m slow  # Run only slow tests
pytest tests/           # Run all tests
```

---

### ❓ **Category 5: Missing Implementation** - ~3 tests

**Reason:** Features not yet implemented or modules missing

**Examples:**
- Tests for features that were planned but not built
- Import errors for optional modules

**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS REVIEW**
**Action:** Either implement features or delete tests

## 📋 Detailed Breakdown

### By Test File

| File | Skipped | Reason Category | Action |
|------|---------|----------------|---------|
| `test_api_voice_arrays.py` | 4 | Server required | Keep (legitimate) |
| `test_auto_orchestrator.py` | 3 | API changed | Refactor tests |
| `test_input_adapters_integration.py` | 8 | API changed | Refactor tests |
| `test_web_ui_integration.py` | ~30 | Server required | Keep (legitimate) |
| `test_end_to_end.py` | ~40 | Slow tests | Keep (legitimate) |
| `test_pipeline_integration.py` | ~20 | Slow tests | Keep (legitimate) |
| `test_integration_comprehensive.py` | ~10 | Slow tests | Keep (legitimate) |
| Other files | ~13 | Mixed | Review individually |

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Session)

**1. Remove Unnecessary Skips** (5 min)
- H2 splitting test - skip removed (already passing)
- Any other tests that now work

**2. Document Skip Reasons** (10 min)
- Ensure all skips have clear reason strings
- Categorize in test file docstrings

### Short Term (Next Week)

**3. Refactor API-Changed Tests** (3-4 hours)
- Update 25 tests for new PipelineOrchestrator API
- Fix YouTube adapter test mocking
- Update programmatic adapter tests

**4. Review Missing Implementation Tests** (1 hour)
- Identify tests for unimplemented features
- Either implement or delete

### Long Term (Next Month)

**5. Add More Slow Tests** (Optional)
- Full end-to-end video generation
- Complete workflow validation
- Performance regression tests

## 📊 Skip Analysis Summary

**Total: 128 skipped tests**

| Category | Count | Status | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Legitimate** (server/slow) | ~90 | ✅ Correct | Keep |
| **API Changes** | ~25 | ⚠️ Needs work | Refactor |
| **Fixed** | 1 | ✅ Done | Remove skip |
| **Missing Features** | ~3 | ❓ Review | Implement or delete |
| **Unknown** | ~9 | ❓ Review | Investigate |

**Acceptable skip rate:** ~15% (90 legitimate / 612 total)
**Current skip rate:** 20.9% (128 / 612)
**Gap:** ~25-35 tests that could be fixed

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Good News:**
- ~70% of skips are legitimate (server/slow tests)
- Only ~25-35 tests actually need fixing
- H2 splitting test now passing (1 less skip)

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Document all skip reasons (this file)
2. ⚠️ Schedule 3-4 hours to refactor API-changed tests
3. ✅ Keep slow/server tests skipped (working as intended)
4. ❓ Review ~12 unknown skips individually

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Can deploy without fixing these, but reduces uncertainty
