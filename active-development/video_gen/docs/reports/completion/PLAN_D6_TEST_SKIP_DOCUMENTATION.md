## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: Adapter Migration (68 tests, 38%)

**Status:** Temporary - Will be enabled after ADR_001 implementation
**Target:** November 2025
**Effort:** 12-15 days

**Subcategories:**
- Examples module tests (8)
- Private method tests (15)
- ProgrammaticAdapter tests (4)
- Helper function tests (6)
- WizardAdapter tests (5)
- Integration tests (4)
- Deprecated API tests (12)
- Export functionality tests (3)

**Rationale:**
Architectural consolidation moved from `app/input_adapters` (sync) to `video_gen/input_adapters` (async). These tests validate the old API and will be migrated via compatibility layer.

**Reference:** docs/architecture/ADR_001_INPUT_ADAPTER_CONSOLIDATION.md

---

### Category 2: Feature Not Implemented (55 tests, 31%)

**Status:** Permanent until feature development
**Priority:** Variable by subcategory

**Subcategories:**
1. **Audio/TTS Generation (12 tests)** - Priority: Low
   - TTS library integration not on critical path
   - Estimated effort: 20-30 hours

2. **Video Rendering Features (18 tests)** - Priority: Medium
   - Transitions, scene renderers, composition, A/V sync
   - Some features desired for v2.0
   - Estimated effort: 40-60 hours

3. **Pipeline & Stage System (13 tests)** - Priority: Low
   - Current pipeline works well
   - Estimated effort: 30-40 hours

4. **Performance & Optimization (8 tests)** - Priority: Low
   - GPU support, parallelization, caching
   - Implement only if performance issues arise
   - Estimated effort: 20-30 hours

5. **Resource Management (4 tests)** - Priority: Low
   - Asset management, file validation
   - Estimated effort: 10-15 hours

**Recommendation:** Evaluate which features are needed for v2.0, enable tests incrementally as features are developed.

---

### Category 3: Conditional Tests (32 tests, 18%)

**Status:** Permanent - Environmental dependency
**Effort:** 0 hours (no code changes needed)

**Subcategories:**
- File existence (5 tests)
- Module availability (20 tests)
- API keys (2 tests)
- Network tests (5 tests)

**Rationale:**
These tests skip based on runtime conditions and work correctly when conditions are met. This is the correct behavior for conditional tests.

**Recommendation:** Add pytest markers for filtering:
```bash
pytest -m "network"  # Run network tests
pytest -m "requires_files"  # Run file-dependent tests
```

---

### Category 4: Web Server Required (18 tests, 10%)

**Status:** Permanent - Integration tests
**Effort:** 0 hours (tests work when server running)

**Affected Files:**
- test_api_voice_arrays.py (5 tests)
- test_integration.py (13 tests)

**Rationale:**
These tests validate the web API and require a running web server. This is correct for integration tests.

**Recommendation:** Run in CI/CD pipeline with server startup, use `@pytest.mark.integration` marker.

---

### Category 5: Performance/Profiling Tests (7 tests, 4%)

**Status:** Permanent - Manual/CI only
**Effort:** 0 hours (tests work when profiling enabled)

**Test Types:**
- CPU profiling
- Memory profiling
- I/O profiling
- Network profiling

**Rationale:**
These tests are expensive to run and should be opt-in via markers.

**Recommendation:** Use `@pytest.mark.slow` and `@pytest.mark.profiling` markers, run on-demand.

---

## Actionable Summary

### Tests That Can Be Enabled Soon
**68 tests (38%)** - Awaiting ADR_001 compatibility layer
- All adapter migration tests
- Target: November 2025
- Effort: 12-15 days

### Tests That Are Correct As-Is
**57 tests (32%)** - Permanent skips, working correctly
- 32 conditional tests
- 18 integration tests
- 7 profiling tests
- No action needed

### Tests That Are Feature-Dependent
**55 tests (31%)** - Require feature development
- Variable priorities
- Implement based on product roadmap
- Estimated effort: 40-80 hours per feature area

---

## Quality Standards Established

### Acceptable Skip Reasons ✅
- "Requires running web server" - Integration test, architectural
- "YouTube API not available" - Conditional on environment
- "Private method removed - see ADR_001" - Architectural change with documentation
- "Requires TTS implementation" - Feature not yet developed
- "Requires profiling tools" - Expensive test, opt-in

### Unacceptable Skip Reasons ❌
- "Test broken" - Fix or delete test
- "TODO" - Not informative
- "Skipping for now" - Vague, no rationale
- No skip reason - Must have reason

### Documentation Standards
Every skip must include:
1. **Reason:** Clear explanation why skipped
2. **Reference:** Link to ADR, issue, or documentation (if applicable)
3. **Condition:** What needs to happen to enable test (if temporary)

---

## Pytest Marker Strategy Recommended

Add to pytest.ini:
```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    network: marks tests requiring network access
    integration: marks tests requiring web server or full system
    requires_files: marks tests requiring specific files to exist
    profiling: marks tests that perform performance profiling
    adapter_migration: marks tests awaiting ADR_001 completion
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Run only fast unit tests (default)
pytest -m "not slow and not network and not integration"

# Run all tests including slow ones
pytest -m ""

# Run only integration tests
pytest -m "integration"

# Run tests awaiting adapter migration
pytest -m "adapter_migration"
```
