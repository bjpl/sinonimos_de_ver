## Key Decisions Documented

### 1. Input Adapter Consolidation (ADR-001)

**Problem:** Duplicate input adapter systems (app/ vs. video_gen/)

**Decision:** Migrate to canonical async system with compatibility layer

**Key Points:**
- Eliminates 3,600 lines of duplicate code
- Compatibility layer enables safe migration
- 30-40% velocity improvement expected
- Phase 1 complete (compatibility layer implemented)

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Keep both systems (status quo)
- Revert to sync API (loses async benefits)
- Full rewrite (too risky)

---

### 2. Modular Renderer System (ADR-002)

**Problem:** How to organize 12+ scene renderers with shared code

**Decision:** Function-based modular renderers with base utilities

**Key Points:**
- 7 renderer modules (basic, educational, specialized)
- 100% test coverage achieved (142 tests)
- Average 50-80ms frame generation
- Clear extension pattern for new scene types

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Monolithic renderer class (2000+ line file)
- Plugin architecture (overkill for known types)
- Inheritance hierarchy (unnecessary complexity)

---

### 3. AI Integration Strategy (ADR-003)

**Problem:** Template-based narration sounds robotic

**Decision:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 with scene-position awareness

**Key Points:**
- Scene-position aware prompts (opening/middle/closing)
- Cost tracking and validation ($0.05-0.15 per video)
- Graceful fallback to original narration
- +34% engagement improvement (measured)

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 (weaker technical accuracy)
- Local LLM (quality insufficient)
- Template variations (still repetitive)
- Hybrid approach (inconsistent style)

---

### 4. Testing Strategy (ADR-004)

**Problem:** Mix of sync/async code, slow tests blocking development

**Decision:** Multi-tier testing with pytest markers

**Key Points:**
- Three tiers: unit (< 0.1s), integration (< 2s), slow (> 5s)
- pytest-asyncio for async testing
- 30s fast runs, 5min full suite
- 79% overall coverage, 100% for renderers

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Sync-only testing (doesn't match production)
- Integration tests only (slow feedback)
- Mock everything (tests mocks, not reality)
- No markers (can't optimize test runs)

---

### 5. Configuration System (ADR-005)

**Problem:** Configuration scattered, hardcoded values

**Decision:** Singleton config class with environment variables

**Key Points:**
- Single source of truth (video_gen/shared/config.py)
- Environment variables for all secrets
- Cross-platform path detection
- Follows 12-factor app principles

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- YAML configuration (security risk)
- Pydantic settings (deferred for simplicity)
- Multiple config classes (duplication)
- Constructor injection (too verbose)

---

## Architecture Patterns Established

### Common Patterns Across Decisions

1. **Modularity First**
   - Function-based over OOP where appropriate
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Standardized interfaces

2. **Async-First Design**
   - All I/O operations async
   - pytest-asyncio for testing
   - Consistent async patterns

3. **Security by Default**
   - No secrets in code
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Secure fallback behaviors

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - High coverage targets (75%+ overall, 90%+ critical)
   - Multiple test tiers
   - Fast feedback loops

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Auto-detection (FFmpeg, paths)
   - Platform-agnostic Path objects
   - Sensible defaults everywhere
