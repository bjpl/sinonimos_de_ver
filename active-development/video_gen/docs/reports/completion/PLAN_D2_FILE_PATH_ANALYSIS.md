# Plan D.2: File Path Issues Analysis - Integration Tests

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Task:** Identify and fix file path issues in integration tests
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - No file path issues found
**Time:** 30 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** All integration test file paths are correct and working. No tests are being skipped due to file path issues.

- **Tests Checked:** 45 integration tests across 3 test files
- **File Paths Verified:** 7 files (all exist and accessible)
- **Tests Skipped Due to File Paths:** 0
- **Tests Actually Passing:** 31 (including all file-path-dependent tests)

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Tests With File Existence Checks

All tests that dynamically check for file existence are **PASSING**:

| Test | Status | File Path | Verification |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `test_yaml_parsing_stage` | ✅ PASSING | `inputs/example_simple.yaml` | File exists, 1.8KB |
| `test_yaml_parsing_speed` | ✅ PASSING | `inputs/example_simple.yaml` | File exists, 1.8KB |
| `test_01_document_parsing_multilingual` | ✅ PASSING | `README.md` | File exists, 72.8KB |
| `test_internet_guide_readme` | ✅ PASSING | `inputs/Internet_Guide_README.md` | File exists, 2.0KB |
| `test_vol1_core_infrastructure` | ✅ PASSING | `inputs/Internet_Guide_Vol1_Core_Infrastructure.md` | File exists, 19.3KB |
| `test_multiple_volumes` | ✅ PASSING | All 4 volume files | All exist, 14-35KB each |

### Files Verified

All test data files exist and are accessible:

```
✅ /video_gen/inputs/example_simple.yaml (1.8KB)
✅ /video_gen/README.md (72.8KB)
✅ /video_gen/inputs/Internet_Guide_README.md (2.0KB)
✅ /video_gen/inputs/Internet_Guide_Vol1_Core_Infrastructure.md (19.3KB)
✅ /video_gen/inputs/Internet_Guide_Vol2_Protocols_Standards.md (14.4KB)
✅ /video_gen/inputs/Internet_Guide_Vol3_Naming_Data_Transmission.md (26.8KB)
✅ /video_gen/inputs/Internet_Guide_Vol4_Security_Future.md (34.9KB)
```

### Skipped Tests Analysis

6 tests are skipped, but **NONE due to file path issues**:

| Test | Skip Reason | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `test_export_speed` | `export_to_yaml()` method removed | API Deprecation |
| `test_yaml_to_export_roundtrip` | `export_to_yaml()` method removed | API Deprecation |
| `test_document_export_to_yaml` | `export_to_yaml()` method removed | API Deprecation |
| `test_programmatic_video_config_creation` | VideoConfig signature changed | API Change |
| `test_programmatic_video_set_export` | YAML export functionality removed | API Deprecation |
| `test_multiple_videos_in_set` | VideoConfig signature changed | API Change |

All skips are due to:
- **Deprecated APIs:** `export_to_yaml()` method was removed from VideoSet
- **API Changes:** VideoConfig constructor signature changed (voice → voices, scenes require SceneConfig)

### Test Results Summary

```
Integration Test Suite:
  ✅ Passed:  31 tests
  ❌ Failed:   8 tests (validation/type errors, not file paths)
  ⏭️  Skipped:  6 tests (API deprecation, not file paths)

File Path Specific:
  ✅ Tests with file checks passing: 6/6 (100%)
  ❌ Tests skipped due to paths:     0
```

### Failed Tests (Not File Path Related)

8 tests are failing due to **validation and type errors**, not file paths:

1. **Validation Errors** (5 tests):
   - Missing required YAML fields (video_id, title, scene_id, narration)
   - Invalid YAML structure

2. **Type Errors** (3 tests):
   - `'SceneConfig' object is not subscriptable`
   - File reading issues in error test cases

---

## Path Resolution Verification

Tests use correct path resolution:

```python
# Pattern used in tests (CORRECT):
yaml_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "inputs" / "example_simple.yaml"
# Resolves to: /video_gen/inputs/example_simple.yaml ✅

readme_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "README.md"
# Resolves to: /video_gen/README.md ✅
```

---

## Conclusion

**No file path fixes needed.** All integration test file paths are correct and working as expected.

### What This Means:

1. ✅ **File paths are correct** - No changes needed
2. ✅ **Test files exist** - All 7 test data files present
3. ✅ **Tests are running** - 31 passing tests include all file-dependent tests
4. ⚠️ **Real issues are elsewhere**:
   - 8 failing tests due to validation/type errors
   - 6 skipped tests due to deprecated APIs

### Recommendations:

**Priority 1 - Fix Failing Tests:**
- Address validation errors (missing YAML fields)
- Fix SceneConfig type errors
- Update error test cases

**Priority 2 - Update Deprecated API Tests:**
- Replace `export_to_yaml()` with new export functionality
- Update VideoConfig usage to new API
- Migrate SceneConfig construction

**Priority 3 (Optional) - Enhance:**
- Add more file path edge case tests
- Test with invalid/malformed file paths
- Add cross-platform path tests

## Code Examples

### Current (Correct) Path Pattern:
```python
# All tests use this pattern correctly:
def test_yaml_parsing_stage(self):
    yaml_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "inputs" / "example_simple.yaml"

    if not yaml_path.exists():  # Safety check
        pytest.skip(f"Test file not found: {yaml_path}")

    # Test continues... ✅
```

### Why This Works:
- `__file__` = test file location
- `.parent.parent` = go up to project root
- `/inputs/filename` = navigate to inputs directory
- Result: Correct absolute path every time
