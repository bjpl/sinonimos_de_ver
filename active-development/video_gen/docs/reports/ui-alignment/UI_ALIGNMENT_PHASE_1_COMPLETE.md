## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. New Scene-Specific Forms (6 added + 1 enhanced)

**Added complete forms for:**
- `code_comparison` - Before/after code comparison with labels
- `quote` - Quote text with attribution
- `learning_objectives` - Lesson title with objectives list
- `problem` - Problem title, description, difficulty selector
- `solution` - Solution code with explanation
- `exercise` - Exercise title, instructions, hints
- `checkpoint` - Learned topics vs. next topics grid

**Enhanced existing:**
- `title` - Improved with better defaults

### 2. Universal Duration Controls

**Added to ALL 12 scene types:**
- `min_duration` input (default: 3.0s)
- `max_duration` input (default: 15.0s)
- Explanatory text about audio-first generation
- Consistent styling and validation

### 3. Voice Rotation Explainer

**Added to Quick Start UI (create.html):**
- Visual explanation of 1-track, 2-track, 3+ track rotation patterns
- Real-world examples (conversations, interviews, tutorials)
- Color-coded educational component

### 4. Backend Integration

**Enhanced JavaScript transformations:**
- Array conversion for: objectives, hints, learned_topics, next_topics
- Code field handling: before_code, after_code, code
- Split on newlines, filter empty entries
- Maintains backward compatibility

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

**Manual Testing:**
1. Create video using each of 12 scene types in Builder
2. Test duration controls with various min/max values
3. Verify voice rotation patterns in Quick Start
4. Test array transformations (objectives, hints, code)
5. Verify backward compatibility with existing videos

**Automated Testing:**
- Unit tests for JavaScript array transformations
- Integration tests for scene form submission
- E2E tests for complete video generation flow
