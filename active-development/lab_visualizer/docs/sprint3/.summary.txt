DOCUMENTS CREATED:
- /docs/sprint3/SPRINT_3_ROADMAP.md (~1,200 lines)
- /docs/sprint3/INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md (~800 lines)
- /docs/sprint3/PLANNING_SUMMARY.md (~500 lines)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Sprint 1-2: 5,750 LOC complete ✅
- Sprint 3: 6,350 LOC planned
- Timeline: 4 weeks (24 days)
- Team: 5.5-9 FTEs
- Cost: ~5/month (MVP)

CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS:
1. LOD ↔ Mol* (6 days, HIGH complexity)
2. Collaboration ↔ Mol* (7 days, HIGH complexity)
3. Data Pipeline (6 days, MEDIUM complexity)

RISKS:
- 🔴 Mol* integration complexity (75% probability)
- 🔴 Performance degradation (50% probability)
- 🟡 Collaboration latency (40% probability)

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Lighthouse > 85
- Load time < 3s
- FPS > 30
- Coverage > 70%

STATUS: READY FOR SPRINT KICKOFF ✅
