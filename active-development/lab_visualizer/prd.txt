## 1. Product Vision

Develop a scalable, browser-first interactive platform to explore and simulate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) structures across multiple scales—from atomic protein structures to full bacterial cells—with integrated, adaptive learning content and collaborative features. The platform will leverage open scientific data and provide real-time molecular dynamics simulations embedded within a modern cloud-native deployment using Vercel and Supabase.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

- Deliver reactive, multi-scale 3D molecular visualization with intuitive simulation capabilities.  
- Integrate rich, contextual educational content with embedded videos, guides, and infographics.  
- Enable collaborative sessions, real-time annotations, and sharing/exporting of visualizations.  
- Use a modern, scalable tech stack with CI/CD and developer-friendly workflows via Vercel and Supabase.  

**Success Metrics:**  
- Adoption in at least 10 academic or research programs within 12 months.  
- 80% user engagement with learning modules and/or simulations.  
- Positive user satisfaction feedback on usability and educational effectiveness.

- Scale navigations between atomic proteins, cell wall models, and cellular morphologies.  
- Layer toggling, cross-sectional views, color/representation schemes adjustable by the user.  
- Adaptive context-sensitive annotation overlays linked to rich learning content.  

### B. Data Integration  
- Dynamic fetching from RCSB PDB, AlphaFold DB, UniProt, NCBI Genomes APIs.  
- Local user upload for structure files in PDB, mmCIF, or AlphaFold formats.  
- Automated metadata enrichment with literature citations and experimental details.  

### C. Real-Time Molecular Simulation  
- Embedded WebDynamica and JSmol engines enabling browser-based molecular dynamics, folding, ligand docking, and energy minimization.  
- Parameterized scenario templates for common educational simulations.  
- Seamless handoff to desktop molecular editors/simulators (Avogadro, OpenMD).  

### D. Embedded Learning Ecosystem  
- On-demand videos, markdown guides, infographics, and resource drawers tied directly to visual features or simulation states.  
- Peer-reviewed content with tagging and version control in Supabase.  
- Learning pathways based on expertise level (beginner, advanced).  

### E. Collaboration & Export  
- Shared real-time annotation and leader-guided sessions with Supabase Realtime synchronization.  
- Export options: images (PNG, TIFF), 3D models (glTF, OBJ), annotated PDFs, and generatable sharable scene/session URLs.  

### F. Accessibility & Device Support  
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessible UI, keyboard navigable, colorblind-safe palettes.  
- Mobile-responsive, progressive enhancement for lower-power devices.

## 5. Deployment Architecture & API Details

### Frontend (Vercel)  
- Next.js app with React and TypeScript.  
- Static assets and server-side rendered content hosted globally via Vercel CDN.  
- Client libraries for molecular visualization and simulation integrated.  
- Access management via Supabase Auth.

### Backend & Database (Supabase)  
- Managed PostgreSQL for user data, annotation, learning modules, session states.  
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for privacy and data access control.  
- Storage buckets for user-uploaded files, simulations outputs, videos.  
- Realtime API powering live collaboration and updates.

### API Interaction  
- RESTful/Supabase endpoints allow clients to manage molecules, sessions, annotations, guides, and users.  
- Secure function endpoints run on Vercel Edge or Supabase Edge Functions for custom workflows or heavy API operations.  
- External data APIs (RCSB, AlphaFold, UniProt) are accessed client-side or proxied server-side, with caching and error fallback.
