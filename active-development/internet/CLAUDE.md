# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** for spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### 🎯 CRITICAL: Claude Code Task Tool for Agent Execution

**Claude Code's Task tool is the PRIMARY way to spawn agents:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Claude Code's Task tool for parallel agent execution
[Single Message]:
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze requirements and patterns...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality...", "reviewer")
  Task("Architect agent", "Design system architecture...", "system-architect")
```

**MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup:**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize coordination topology
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Define agent types for coordination
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows

### 📁 File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code

## 🎯 Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL EXECUTION:
- **Task tool**: Spawn and run agents concurrently for actual work
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY COORDINATE:
- Swarm initialization (topology setup)
- Agent type definitions (coordination patterns)
- Task orchestration (high-level planning)
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates the strategy, Claude Code's Task tool executes with real agents.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# Add MCP servers (Claude Flow required, others optional)
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start  # Optional: Enhanced coordination
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start  # Optional: Cloud features
```

## MCP Tool Categories

### Coordination
`swarm_init`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`

### Monitoring
`swarm_status`, `agent_list`, `agent_metrics`, `task_status`, `task_results`

### Memory & Neural

### GitHub Integration
`github_swarm`, `repo_analyze`, `pr_enhance`, `issue_triage`, `code_review`

### System
`benchmark_run`, `features_detect`, `swarm_monitor`

### Flow-Nexus MCP Tools (Optional Advanced Features)
Flow-Nexus extends MCP capabilities with 70+ cloud-based orchestration tools:

**Key MCP Tool Categories:**
- **Swarm & Agents**: `swarm_init`, `swarm_scale`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`

- Login: `mcp__flow-nexus__user_login` or `npx flow-nexus@latest login`
- Access 70+ specialized MCP tools for advanced orchestration

## 🚀 Agent Execution Flow with Claude Code

### The Correct Pattern:

1. **Optional**: Use MCP tools to set up coordination topology
2. **REQUIRED**: Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agents that do actual work
3. **REQUIRED**: Each agent runs hooks for coordination
4. **REQUIRED**: Batch all operations in single messages

### Example Full-Stack Development:

```javascript
// Single message with all agent spawning via Claude Code's Task tool
[Parallel Agent Execution]:
  Task("Backend Developer", "Build REST API with Express. Use hooks for coordination.", "backend-dev")
  Task("Frontend Developer", "Create React UI. Coordinate with backend via memory.", "coder")
  Task("Database Architect", "Design PostgreSQL schema. Store schema in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Test Engineer", "Write Jest tests. Check memory for API contracts.", "tester")
  Task("DevOps Engineer", "Setup Docker and CI/CD. Document in memory.", "cicd-engineer")
  Task("Security Auditor", "Review authentication. Report findings via hooks.", "reviewer")
  
  // All todos batched together
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }
  
  // All file operations together
  Write "backend/server.js"
  Write "frontend/App.jsx"
  Write "database/schema.sql"
```

## 📋 Agent Coordination Protocol

### Every Agent Spawned via Task Tool MUST:

**1️⃣ BEFORE Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"
```

**2️⃣ DURING Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"
```

**3️⃣ AFTER Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

## 🎯 Concurrent Execution Examples

### ✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW: MCP Coordinates, Claude Code Executes

```javascript
// Step 1: MCP tools set up coordination (optional, for complex tasks)
[Single Message - Coordination Setup]:
  mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester" }

// Step 2: Claude Code Task tool spawns ACTUAL agents that do the work
[Single Message - Parallel Agent Execution]:
  // Claude Code's Task tool spawns real agents concurrently
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze API requirements and best practices. Check memory for prior decisions.", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement REST endpoints with authentication. Coordinate via hooks.", "coder")
  Task("Database agent", "Design and implement database schema. Store decisions in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage.", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality and security. Document findings.", "reviewer")
  
  // Batch ALL todos in ONE call
  TodoWrite { todos: [
    {id: "1", content: "Research API patterns", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
    {id: "2", content: "Design database schema", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
    {id: "3", content: "Implement authentication", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "4", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "5", content: "Write unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
    {id: "6", content: "Integration tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
    {id: "7", content: "API documentation", status: "pending", priority: "low"},
    {id: "8", content: "Performance optimization", status: "pending", priority: "low"}
  ]}
  
  // Parallel file operations
  Bash "mkdir -p app/{src,tests,docs,config}"
  Write "app/package.json"
  Write "app/src/server.js"
  Write "app/tests/server.test.js"
  Write "app/docs/API.md"
```

### ❌ WRONG (Multiple Messages):
```javascript
Message 1: mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init
Message 2: Task("agent 1")
Message 3: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 4: Write "file.js"
// This breaks parallel coordination!
```
